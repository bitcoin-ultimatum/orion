# macOS Build Instructions and Notes

The commands in this guide should be executed in a Terminal application.
The built-in one is located in
```
    /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app
```

## Prerequisites
In order to build BTCU on Mac it is required to have a MacOS computer, with at least 3GB of free disk space (some of the dependencies will require more space, but you may have these installed already) without the database.

## Preparation
The next step is required only if you don't have an already instaled XCode. Otherwise you may skip it.
Install the macOS command line tools:

```shell
    xcode-select --install
```

When the popup appears, click `Install`.
You can check the [detailed installation guide](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macmingweclipse/allexperimental/macxcodecommandlinetools.html) for a proper explanation.

Then you will need to install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). If you already have it on a computer you may skip it.

To check it you can run the followed command:

```shell
    brew --version
```

If it throws an error, you don't have homebrew. In that case, install homebrew using the following command.
```shell
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

It is important:  Even if you had homebrew installed beforehand, update your version of homebrew and upgrade all the packages it installed by running the following command.
```shell
    brew update && brew upgrade
```

## Troubleshooting
### Brew problems
If you see throught brew installation process errors like  `LibreSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection`, try:
```shell
    networksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi
```

If you goes into error  `Error: Operation already in progress `, try:
```shell
    rm -rf /usr/local/var/homebrew/locks
```

For other brew-specific issues please check [Homebrew's Troubleshooting page](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting).

### Installation problems
In a case when you get `dmg` image or sources via browser, telegramm and etc you'll face with an error `Operation not permitted` for the application extracted from the the `dmg` or in a terminal thought the building process accordingly.

To solve the problem for the image case:
```shell
    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine btcu-qt.dmg
```
in the download folder where you've placed the file (in that case you will have to reinstall the app from the dmg) or 
```shell
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/btcu-qt.app
```
for the installed app.

### BUILTIN_QTDEPLOY and .dmg building flag caveats
Sometimes the packaging into .dmg step will be failed due to `btcu-qt` image from the previous build is still mounted (error will be like `Permission denied`). You will have to unmount it in order to make it successful.

It is good to unmount all unused images anyway.

### Build problems
If you face with problems in a build process please make sure you've read the instruction carefully and you've done all required steps.

Also please check all Note and Important hints from the instruction. Probably thay have an essential information to solve the problem.

If you face with an error on `cmake` command like `No CMAKE_C_COMPILER could be found.` please run a command:
```shell
    sudo xcode-select --reset
```

## Dependencies
```shell
    brew install automake libtool miniupnpc pkg-config python qt@5 libevent qrencode protobuf snappy zeromq openssl libjson-rpc-cpp google-benchmark googletest cmake git gmp gflags zlib lz4 bzip2 zstd
    # libscrypt from local since we need a version with cmake support but you still can get it via brew
```

If you want to build the disk image with `make osx=dmg` (.dmg / optional), you need RSVG:
```shell
    brew install librsvg
```

OpenSSL has it's uniq way to organize a folder structure so we have to try this command at first:
```shell
    brew link openssl --force
```

If you'll get a refuse result such as "Warning: Refusing to link macOS provided/shadowed software: openssl", you'll have to call this command instead:
```shell
    ( brew --prefix openssl && echo '/include/openssl'; ) | tr -d "[:space:]" | xargs -I '{}' ln -s {} /usr/local/include
```

#### Boost
In order to make things simplier and to support Apple M-series we will have to build Boost from the sources.
To do this please run commands:
```shell
    alias nproc="sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu"

    curl https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.71.0/source/boost_1_71_0.tar.gz -o boost_1_71_0.tar.gz
    tar -xf boost_1_71_0.tar.gz

    cd boost_1_71_0
    ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local/opt/boost --with-python=python3 &&
    sudo ./b2 stage -j$(nproc) cxxflags="-std=c++11" --reconfigure threading=multi link=shared --with-regex --with-test --with-filesystem --with-date_time --with-random --with-system --with-thread --with-program_options --with-chrono --with-fiber --with-log --with-context --with-math && sudo ./b2 install --prefix=/usr/local/opt/boost
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/boost/lib/*.dylib /usr/local/lib
    cd -
```

This will install Boost to the brew default packages folder. You can change it but make sure it is visible in system path for lib and for includes.

#### Rocksdb
If you build on Mac Intell you can just run:
```shell
    brew install rocksdb
```

In an M-series you will have to compile it from the sources:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb.git
    cd rocksdb
    cmake . -DPORTABLE=ON -DUSE_RTTI=ON -DWITH_BENCHMARK_TOOLS=OFF -DWITH_BZ2=O -DWITH_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

    sudo make install
    cd -
```

#### SQLite

Usually, macOS installation already has a suitable SQLite installation.
In order to check is there an installed SQLite you may run a command:

```shell
    sqlite3 --version
```

If you haven't SQLite installed it can be solved by the Homebrew package:

```shell
    brew install sqlite
```

In that case the Homebrew package will prevail.

#### Berkeley DB

It is recommended to use Berkeley DB 18.1.32.

The Homebrew package could be installed:

```shell
    brew install berkeley-db@18
```

The project is configured with the dependency Berkeley DB v18.1.32. In order to check the version you can run:
```shell
    brew info berkeley-db 
```

If the brew installed a different version run the followed command:
```shell
    # since brew switch is depreceted it is required to use workaround
    brew uninstall berkeley-db@18
    # since brew prohibited to use Git commits urls in install command
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/f325e0637fbf513819129744dc107382de028fc5/Formula/berkeley-db.rb -o berkeley-db.rb
    brew install ./berkeley-db.rb
```

## Build BTCU

1. Clone the BTCU source code:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-ultimatum/orion
    cd btcu
```

It is important: Do not use spaces and other line breaking simbols in a path to the downloaded project because it'll cause a compilation problems.

2.  (Optional) Make the Homebrew OpenSSL headers visible to the configure script  (do ```brew info openssl``` to find out why this is necessary, or if you use Homebrew with installation folders different from the default).

        export LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
        export CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/openssl"

3.  Build BTCU

    Configure and build the headless BTCU binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).

    You can disable the GUI build by passing `-DENABLE_GUI=OFF` to cmake.

    The wallet support requires one or both of the dependencies ([*SQLite*](#sqlite) and [*Berkeley DB*](#berkeley-db)) from the previous section.
    To build BTCU without wallet, see [*Disable-wallet mode*](#disable-wallet-mode).

    To build the project run followed commands:
```shell
    cmake .
    make
```

**Note:** : There is a supported flag QUIET for more quiet build. It is usefull.

4.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests:
```shell
    make check
```

5.  You can also create a .dmg that contains the .app bundle (optional):
```shell
    make osx-dmg
```

## Code Signing
In order to sign the application you will have to install you're apple developer certificate on your MacBook.

Next, run CMake with the flag SIGN_DMG. SIGN_DMG is required to tell cmake that it should use codesign tool to sign final .dmg image.

By default cmake will try to detect you developer certificate identifier by himself. It will take the first one from the command `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` (For more information please check file `cmake/scripts/CodeSignIOS.cmake`). The result command will be:
```shell
    cmake . -DSIGN_DMG=ON
    make osx-dmg
```

But you can provide specific certificate name with a flag SIGN_CERT_NAME, e.g.:
```shell
    cmake . -DSIGN_DMG=ON -DSIGN_CERT_NAME="Mac Developer: John Smith"
    make osx-dmg
```
**Important note:** In some cases there will be a problem with missed media resources in the signed app. In that case you will have to recompile the app with the flag BUILTIN_QTDEPLOY.

The flag BUILTIN_QTDEPLOY will tell cmake that it should use macdeployqt from qt package installed from brew on previous steps and the open source python script `contrib\macdeploy\macdeployqtplus.py` will be used only to create fancy-looking installer from the result.

The result command will be:
```shell
    cmake . -DBUILTIN_QTDEPLOY=ON -DSIGN_DMG=ON
    make osx-dmg
```

## Apple Silicon Processors Support (M-Series)
We support build for Apple M-Series processors. You can build a runnable binaries just by following the build step from the instruction.

However if you need to create a .dmg-file you will need to use apple developer certificate since it is required in ARM-architecture in Apple.
In order to do this you will have to install you're apple developer certificate on your M-Series processor. Please check Code Signing section from the instruction. 

It is also important to use BUILTIN_QTDEPLOY for the M-series build. The result command will be:

```shell
    cmake . -DBUILTIN_QTDEPLOY=ON -DSIGN_DMG=ON -DSIGN_CERT_NAME="Mac Developer: John Smith"
```

## XCode build

You can run and build the application from the Apple XCode.
Firstly, you will have to create an XCode project file by the command: 
```shell
    cmake . -G Xcode
```

This will create an btcu.xcodeproj file in a root project folder.
Next, open it via XCode and select target you want. For example it can be `btcu-qt`.
After that you can select options `Run` (⌘R) of `Build` (⌘R).

Happy building!

## Compiling for different MacOS versions
In a case when you need a different version of the OSX platforms add the parameter to a cmake command (for example we use 10.10 version) :
```shell
    cmake . -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.10
```

It may be required to have an installed appopriate SDK version. You can find an instruction how to make it [here](https://gist.github.com/robvanoostenrijk/7a1a32d2071232d9cd98).

## Disable-wallet mode
When the intention is to run only a P2P node without a wallet, BTCU may be
compiled in disable-wallet mode with:
```shell
    cmake . -DENABLE_WALLET=OFF
```

In this case there is no dependency on [*Berkeley DB*](#berkeley-db) and [*SQLite*](#sqlite).

Mining is also possible in disable-wallet mode using the `getblocktemplate` RPC call.

## Running
BTCU is now available at `./bin/btcud`

Before running, it's recommended that you create an RPC configuration file:
```shell
    echo -e "rpcuser=btcurpc\nrpcpassword=$(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)" > "/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/BTCU/btcu.conf"

    chmod 600 "/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/BTCU/btcu.conf"
```

The first time you run btcud, it will start downloading the blockchain. This process could take many hours, or even days on slower than average systems.

You can monitor the download process by looking at the debug.log file:
```shell
    tail -f $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/BTCU/debug.log
```

## Other commands:
```shell
    ./bin/btcud -daemon      # Starts the btcu daemon.
    ./bin/btcu-cli --help    # Outputs a list of command-line options.
    ./bin/btcu-cli help      # Outputs a list of RPC commands when the daemon is running.
    ./bin/btcu-qt      # Start GUI
```

## Notes
* Tested on OS X (11.1 Big Sur and 10.15 Catalina) on 64-bit Intel processors only.
